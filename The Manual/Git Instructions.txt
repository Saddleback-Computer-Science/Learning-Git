||	Mathematics. The purpose for this text is to help students at my school	   ||

||																			   ||
||		I will be trying to make tutorials (documentation and videos) as well, ||
||	to be supplement for learning how to program. This will be an ongoing and  ||

First time use:

1) go to folder ( Make Folder You want to clone into)
2) git init
3) git clone "url"

<<<<<<< HEAD

*****************************************************************************
This is recommended but become comfortable with git before blindly following
these directions.
*****************************************************************************

4) git checkout -b "Name your branch"
	a.

Basic Use:

=======

************************************************************************
Git will only be able to add or commit the project if a file or element has
been modified inside the local git repository.
************************************************************************

When in project folder - MASTER BRANCH:
1) git status
<<<<<<< HEAD
	a. Check for anything that is out of the ordinary such as files that should
		not be commited.
2) git fetch origin
	a. This will download the most recent project commit to be compared against
		the user's current project.
3) git status
	a. If there are changes, type git add "File Name" to stage the file to be
		committed.
	b. If it states that there are no changes compared to the master branch, then
		the online repository was update to most recent commit without actually
		having any commits published. Solutions to this may vary and best to
		consult for help. Easiest way to fix this however would be to go to the
		files that have been modified and add NON-DETRIMENTAL WHITE SPACES and
		save file. This will force the file to appear as modified. Be careful
		not to accidently override code by forcing a push or merge.

EVERYTHING IS COMPARED TO THE BRANCH ORIGIN (IN THIS CASE THE REPOSITORY MASTER
BRANCH) IF A FILE HAS NOT BEEN MODIFIED IT WILL NOT APPEAR WHEN ASKED TO STAGE
FILES!
********************************************************************************
4) Use:
<<<<<<< HEAD
	a. git add "File name" to stage a single file
	b. git add --all to stage all modified files.

	CAREFUL BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO UPLOAD ECLIPSE META DATA IT CAN CAUSE

5) Use:
	**************** THERE HAS TO BE A COMMIT MESSAGE!!!!****************
	a. git commit -m "message" <- Allows message to be entered at the same time

	IF -m is left out, the user will enter the shell text editor called ViM
	Navigating ViM:
		h - left
		j - up
		k - down
		l - right
		i - insert (TYPE TEXT)
		a - append
		ESC - Exit current mode to ViM command line

	The user will start out in the command line of ViM,

	TO EXIT ViM:
		1) Press ESC
		2) Shift + :
		3) type in the letter q
			a. If something has been modified, or it will not let you quit
				- add ! to the end of the letter q then press enter

		Ex ViM interface:
		~
		~                  VIM - Vi IMproved
		~
		~                     version 7.3
		~              by Bram Moolenaar et al.
		~     Vim is open source and freely distributable
		~
		~            Help poor children in Uganda!
		~   type  :help iccf<Enter>       for information
		~
		~   type  :q<Enter>               to exit
		~   type  :help<Enter>  or  <F1>  for on-line help
		~   type  :help version7<Enter>   for version info

	:q!    (<--- command to quit after pressing shift + :)

	Use ESC key to

6) Once the project has been committed, just as a safety precaution
	a. git status
	b. git fetch
	c. If everything is good
		- git push origin

-------------------------
